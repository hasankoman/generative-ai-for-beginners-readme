The course is available online at [https://microsoft.github.io/generative-ai-for-beginners/](https://microsoft.github.io/generative-ai-for-beginners/).\n\n## Project Description\n\nThis project provides a structured learning experience covering various aspects of generative AI, including:\n\n* **Introduction to Generative AI:** Understanding the fundamental concepts and applications.\n* **Exploring LLMs:** Comparing different large language models and their capabilities.\n* **Responsible AI Use:**  Ethical considerations and best practices in generative AI.\n* **Prompt Engineering:** Mastering the art of crafting effective prompts for optimal results.\n* **Building AI Applications:** Hands-on projects using various programming languages and platforms.  This includes building chat applications, search applications, and image generation applications.\n* **Low-Code AI Applications:** Exploring tools and techniques for building AI applications with minimal coding.\n* **Integrating with Function Calling:**  Leveraging function calling to enhance AI application capabilities.\n* **UX for AI Applications:** Designing user experiences tailored to the unique aspects of AI interactions.\n* **Securing AI Applications:** Best practices for secure development and deployment.\n* **Generative AI Application Lifecycle:**  Understanding the complete process from development to deployment.\n* **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Vector Databases:** Using RAG and vector databases for improved information retrieval.\n* **Open Source Models:** Exploring the landscape of available open source models.\n* **AI Agents:** Building and utilizing AI agents to automate tasks.\n* **Fine-tuning LLMs:**  Customizing LLMs to better suit specific needs.\n* **State-less Language Models (SLM):**  Understanding and implementing State-less Language Models\n* **Mistral:**  Working with the Mistral large language model\n* **Meta:** Working with Meta Large Language Models\n\nThe course materials are available in multiple languages.\n\n## Project Structure\n\nThe project is organized into modules, each focusing on a specific topic:\n\n* **`00-course-setup`:** Setup instructions and environment configuration.\n* **`01-introduction-to-genai` - `21-meta`:**  Each numbered folder represents a lesson module, containing the lesson's README.md, code examples (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#), images, and translations in multiple languages (Chinese, Spanish (MX), Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (BR), Traditional Chinese).\n\n\n* **`.github`:** GitHub Actions workflows for automation and code quality.\n* **`docs`:**  Documentation for the website using Docsify.\n* **`images`:** Static images used in the documentation and course materials.\n* **`translations`:** Translations of README and lesson materials.\n\n\n## Setup and Installation\n\n\nDetailed setup instructions are provided in the `00-course-setup` directory.  Refer to the `README.md` and `SETUP.md` files within that directory for complete instructions, including environment setup, and dependency installation.\n\n## Usage Instructions\n\nEach module (`01-introduction-to-genai` through `21-meta`) has its own README.md file which contains detailed instructions and examples of usage for the related concepts and code examples in the module.  Follow these instructions within each module to work through the lessons.\n\n## Contributing\n\nGuidelines for contributing are available in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.\n\n## License\n\nMIT License.  See the `LICENSE` file for details.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nSee the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file for details.\n\n\n## Security\n\nSee the `SECURITY.md` file for information on security best practices and vulnerability reporting.\n\n## Individual Module READMEs\n\nEach numbered module (e.g., `01-introduction-to-genai`) contains a `README.md` file with a summary of the module's content and specific instructions.  These are detailed within their respective directories.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is located in the `docs` directory. The website uses Docsify for generating the online course materials.\n\n## Data Handling\n\nSpecific datasets and APIs used are described within the respective module READMEs.\n\n## Testing\n\nTesting instructions (if applicable) are provided within the individual module READMEs.\n```\n
